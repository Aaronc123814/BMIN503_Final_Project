# BMIN503_Final_Project
Template repo for Data Science for Biomedical Informatics (BMIN503/EPID600) final project

The repository for this specific final project contains several files that explore the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with a variety of demographic variables. In thie rmd file which is listed first, I hope to uses R as a statistical analysis tool to further find how sub groups within the U.S. population experience treatment, care, and deaths differently as compared to the main population of America. I have also included a variety of leaflet graphs to explore which locations are severely impacted by COVID-19. The html format is same as the rmd, but contains visual elements.
